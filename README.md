Aparecium is a Python package for revealing text from embedding vectors, particularly designed to work with SentiChain embeddings. Named after the Harry Potter spell that reveals hidden writing, Aparecium provides state-of-the-art tools for converting between text and vector representations, as well as reversing the embedding process to recover original text.

## Features

- **Text Vectorization**: Convert text into dense vector representations using pre-trained transformer models
- **Embedding Reversal**: Reconstruct original text from embedding vectors using a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with SentiChain embeddings to reveal hidden content
- **Modern Architecture**: Built on PyTorch and Transformers for optimal performance
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to integrate with custom models and architectures

## Limitations & Caveats

- Complete reconstruction of original text from embeddings is not always guaranteed and depends heavily on the fidelity and nature of the embeddings.
- For best results, ensure that the model and embeddings are aligned (e.g., same tokenization and dimension).
- While Aparecium is designed for SentiChain embeddings, it can be adapted to other embedding pipelines if they provide a compatible dimensionality.

## Model Architecture

Aparecium employs a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture for text reconstruction. The model consists of:

- **Input Layer**: Processes embedding vectors of shape (sequence_length, d_model)
- **Embedding Layer**: Combines token and positional embeddings
- **Transformer Decoder Stack**: Multiple decoder layers with multi-head attention
- **Output Layer**: Projects decoder outputs to vocabulary space

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install aparecium
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SentiChain/aparecium.git
cd aparecium
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Text to Vector Conversion

```python
from aparecium import Vectorizer

# Initialize the vectorizer with a pre-trained model
vectorizer = Vectorizer(model_name="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2")

# Convert text to vector representation
text = "This is sample text to be vectorized."
embedding_vectors = vectorizer.encode(text)

# embedding_vectors shape: (sequence_length, embedding_dimension)
```

### Vector to Text Reconstruction

```python
from aparecium import Seq2SeqReverser

# Load the pre-trained model from Hugging Face Hub
reverser = Seq2SeqReverser.from_pretrained("SentiChain/aparecium-seq2seq-reverser")

# Reconstruct text from embedding vectors
recovered_text = reverser.generate_text(embedding_vectors)
print(recovered_text)
```

Note: The pre-trained model is specifically trained on crypto market-related sentences. For best results, use it with similar content.

Alternatively, you can load the model from a local directory:

```python
from aparecium import Seq2SeqReverser

# Initialize the reverser
reverser = Seq2SeqReverser()

# Load the pre-trained model from a local directory
reverser.load_model("path/to/model/directory")

# Reconstruct text from embedding vectors
recovered_text = reverser.generate_text(embedding_vectors)
print(recovered_text)
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains several comprehensive examples:

- `train_pipeline.py`: Complete training pipeline for the text reconstruction model
- `train_reverser.py`: Script for training the embedding reverser model
- `generate_sentences.py`: Example of generating text from embedding vectors
- `config.py`: Configuration management for training and inference

For detailed usage examples, please refer to the individual example files in the `examples/` directory.
